## 1) Ceremony & Gathering Options
| Option | What it is | Typical elements | When it helps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Home funeral** | Family and friends care for the body and host visiting or rites in a private residence; may involve a home vigil for up to 2–3 days with cooling (ice packs/dry ice). | Washing and dressing, simple viewing, music/readings, faith rituals, meal afterward. Funeral director involvement optional in many jurisdictions (check local law). | Maximum family involvement, low cost, familiar setting.
| **Funeral service** | Service with the body present, usually within a week of death. May include visitation/viewing before the ceremony. | Procession, clergy/celebrant, eulogy, readings, music, military or fraternal honors, flowers. | Public farewell with structured ritual; can precede burial or cremation.
| **Memorial service** | Ceremony without the body present (cremated remains may be present). | Photos/video tribute, readings, music, sharing circle, reception. Flexible timing (days to months later). | When timing, travel, or disposition choices make having the body present difficult.
| **Graveside service** | Short service at the burial site before interment. | Committal prayers/words, military honors, placing flowers/soil on the grave, brief memories. | Pair with burial after a funeral, or as the only ceremony for a simple plan.
| **Burial at sea (disposition & service)** | Committal on a vessel offshore. Options include full-body burial (with weight and biodegradable shroud/casket) where permitted, or scattering cremated remains. | Charter vessel, Coast Guard/flag notification, coordinates recorded, brief ceremony. | Maritime affinity, returning to a favorite coastline, space constraints on land.

## 2) Disposition Options (What happens to the body or remains)
For each option, check your state/provincial rules and provider availability.

### A. Burial (Traditional)
- **Container**: Metal or hardwood casket; vault/outer burial container often required by cemeteries for ground stability.
- **Preparation**: Embalming common when there will be public viewing over multiple days; refrigeration is an alternative.
- **Setting**: Conventional cemetery; private or family plots require local approval.

### B. Green/Natural Burial
- **Container**: Biodegradable casket, woven carrier, or shroud. Vaults are not used.
- **Preparation**: No embalming with formaldehyde; use cooling/dry ice instead.
- **Setting**: Green-certified cemetery section or conservation burial ground with minimal landscaping and native plantings.

### C. Cremation
- **Cremation container**: Rigid, combustible container (cardboard, softwood) is used instead of a full casket unless you choose an upgraded casket.
- **Urn options**: 
  - Keepsake, scattering tube, biodegradable water urn, ceramic/wood/metal display urn, shared mini-urns.
  - Burial of urn in a cemetery lot or columbarium niche; at-home retention; scattering where permitted.
- **Burial choices**: Earth burial of urn, columbarium placement, or scattering garden.

### D. Alkaline Hydrolysis (Water Cremation)
- **Process**: Uses water, alkali, heat, and pressure to reduce remains to bone fragments, then dried and processed similar to cremated remains.
- **Container**: No combustible casket; a specialized cradle or shroud is used within the chamber.
- **Urn options**: Same choices as flame cremation (display, keepsake, scattering, biodegradable, burial/niche).
- **Burial choices**: Urn burial, niche, or scattering per local rules.

### E. Natural Organic Reduction (Human Composting)
- **Process**: Body placed in a vessel with organic material (wood chips/straw); gently aerated for several weeks until it becomes soil.
- **Container**: No embalming; shroud or simple biodegradable carrier only.
- **Urn/soil options**: Portion of soil returned to family (container of choice), remainder may be donated to restoration projects if desired.
- **Soil designation**: Use on private land with permission, around memorial plantings, or donate to partner forests/gardens according to provider policy.

## 3) Memorialization & Personalization Options
### Merchandise Examples
- **Eco garments & carriers**: Mushroom/mycelium burial suit, woven willow or seagrass casket, biodegradable urns.
- **Nature-forward keepsakes**: Tree pod/urn with seedling, flower-embedded paper urn for scattering.
- **Creative keepsakes**: Art glass infused with remains, vinyl record with audio of your choosing, custom jewelry, 3D-printed memorials, paintings incorporating remains, etched stone or wood plaques.
- **Marine options**: Eternal reef casting with cremated remains, biodegradable water urns.

### Services & Experience Options
- **Space & travel**: Memorial spaceflight for a symbolic portion of cremated remains; scattering charter by air or sea.
- **Participation**: Family attending cremation start (where allowed), witnessing placement into an eternal reef, or accompanying soil/urn to its final site.
- **Legacy & giving**: Donation of soil from natural organic reduction to reforestation projects; memorial funds, scholarship in your name, digital memorial site.
- **Ritual additions**: Honor guard, cultural rites, open-mic stories, favorite music/poetry, themed attire requests, recipe cards or seed packets as take-home keepsakes.

## 4) Decision Roadmap (do you know all your options?)
Use these questions before finalizing:
1. **Ceremony**: Do you want a gathering with the body present, with cremated remains present, or none? Home, funeral venue, outdoor, or online livestream?
2. **Timing**: Need quick simplicity, or flexibility for travel? Memorial services allow later dates.
3. **Disposition**: Which method aligns with your values (earth return, low emissions, maritime, conservation, technological)?
4. **Viewing**: Is viewing important? If yes, choose preparation that fits your disposition (e.g., refrigeration or minimal preservation for green burial; avoid embalming if planning natural organic reduction).
5. **Participation**: How much do you and your family want to do yourselves (home care, washing, carrying, readings, music)?
6. **Budget**: Set a budget range; request itemized price lists from providers.
7. **Regulations**: Note permits for scattering, sea burial distances, cemetery rules, and state availability of alkaline hydrolysis/NOR.
8. **Personal touches**: Identify music, readings, colors, mementos, military/fraternal honors, and guest roles.

## 5) Scenario: “We just want a cremation” — expanding the choices
- **Type of cremation**: Flame cremation vs. alkaline hydrolysis. Direct cremation (no ceremony) vs. cremation with a viewing or service first.
- **Containers**: Simple cardboard container, rental/ceremonial casket for a viewing, or upgraded cremation casket.
- **Witnessing**: Family present at start of cremation or private farewell in the crematory chapel (where allowed).
- **Post-cremation**: Choose urn type, keepsakes, or no urn. Decide on scattering, burial, niche, or keeping at home.
- **Ceremony timing**: Memorial service after cremation, graveside urn burial, or scattering ceremony on land or water with readings and music.
- **Personalization**: Video tribute, art glass keepsakes, jewelry, tree pod, reef casting, or vinyl record.

## 6) Compatibility & Conflicts to Watch
- **Embalming + Green/NOR**: Embalming chemicals conflict with green burial and natural organic reduction; choose refrigeration/dry ice instead.
- **Vault requirements**: Some cemeteries require vaults; green burial grounds prohibit them.
- **Religion/culture**: Some traditions prefer rapid burial without viewing; coordinate timing and preparation accordingly.
- **Sea burial**: Full-body burial at sea requires specific distance-from-shore and depth rules; biodegradable materials only.
- **Home funeral laws**: Next-of-kin may act as funeral agent in many places, but transport permits and death certificates still apply.

---

## 7) Personalization & Participation Ideas
- Invite loved ones to write messages on the casket/shroud or scattering tube.
- Include favorite foods, playlists, or a themed dress code at the reception.
- Create memory tables, recipe cards, seed packets, or photo boards.
- Ask friends to serve as pallbearers, musicians, or storytellers.
- For reef or scattering events, charter a vessel that allows the family to ride along and participate in the placement (ask the provider about capacity and safety rules).

# Planning Your Funeral: Web Guide

A clean, responsive, single-page guide that walks first-time planners through ceremony options, disposition methods, and creative memorialization ideas.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` — Main page with all required content (service options, disposition methods, memorialization, guidance, and checklist).
- `assets/styles.css` — Styling for layout, typography, and responsive behavior.

## Running Locally
Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build step or external tooling is required.

## Customization Tips
- To add a hero photo, supply your own image and update the `.hero` background in `assets/styles.css` (the page ships with a gradient-only background so no binary assets are required).
- Adjust colors or typography in `assets/styles.css` under the `:root` variables.
- All text lives in `index.html`; you can tailor language to local legal requirements or cultural practices.

## Included Content
The page includes:
- Ceremony options: Home Funeral, Funeral Service, Memorial Service, Graveside Service, Burial at Sea.
- Disposition options: Traditional Burial, Green/Natural Burial, Cremation (containers, urns, burial), Alkaline Hydrolysis (Aquamation), and Natural Organic Reduction (soil options).
- Memorialization: Merchandise-based and service-based ideas (reef placement, space flight, art glass, tree pods, and more).
- Guidance: Helping families understand choices, personalization ideas, and compatibility considerations.
- Final checklist: Key questions to confirm wishes and avoid conflicts.

          <h3>Home Funeral</h3>
          <p>Family and friends care for the body in a private home. This may include washing, dressing, viewing, spiritual rituals, storytelling, or quiet time together. Embalming is not required. In many states, families can handle arrangements without a funeral director.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="option">
          <h3>Funeral Service</h3>
          <p>A structured ceremony where the body is present. May include a visitation or viewing period, readings, music, eulogies, and cultural or religious traditions. Embalming is optional. After the funeral, the chosen form of disposition follows.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="option">
          <h3>Memorial Service</h3>
          <p>A ceremony held without the body present. Cremated remains or photos may be displayed. This option allows flexibility in timing and location, and can occur days, weeks, or months after death.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="option">
          <h3>Graveside Service</h3>
          <p>A ceremony held outdoors at the burial site. May involve prayers, readings, military honors, or symbolic gestures such as placing flowers or soil on the casket.</p>

        <article class="option">
          <h3>Burial at Sea</h3>
          <p>A meaningful option for those connected to the ocean. Cremated remains or whole bodies may be placed at sea following federal regulations. Families can often accompany the vessel to participate in the ceremony.</p>

          <article class="option">
            <h4>Traditional Burial</h4>
            <p>The body is placed in a casket and buried in a cemetery plot. A vault or grave liner is often required by the cemetery. Embalming is optional but commonly chosen when there will be a viewing.</p>
          </article>
          <article class="option">
            <h4>Green or Natural Burial</h4>
            <p>An environmentally friendly option using biodegradable materials such as a shroud, wicker casket, or simple wooden box. No vault is used. Embalming with formaldehyde is not permitted; refrigeration or dry ice is used instead. Burial takes place in a natural setting or green cemetery.</p>

      <div class="disposition-group">
        <h3 class="disposition-category">Cremation</h3>
        <article class="option">
          <p>Cremation uses heat to reduce the body to bone fragments, which are then processed into fine remains. Services can be held before or after cremation.</p>
          <p class="list-title">Container</p>
          <p>A cremation container is required. Options include cardboard, unfinished wood, or other combustible materials. A rental casket may be used for viewing before cremation.</p>
          <p class="list-title">Urn Options</p>
          <p>Remains can be placed in a variety of urns: wood, metal, ceramic, biodegradable, keepsake urns for sharing, scattering tubes, or custom art urns.</p>
          <p class="list-title">Burial of Cremated Remains</p>
          <p>Cremated remains may be buried in a cemetery plot, placed in a columbarium niche, scattered in a permitted location, or kept at home.</p>
        </article>

      <div class="disposition-group">
        <h3 class="disposition-category">Alkaline Hydrolysis (Aquamation)</h3>
        <article class="option">
          <p>A water-based process using warm water and alkali to gently accelerate natural decomposition. The process produces remains similar to cremation.</p>
          <p class="list-title">Container</p>
          <p>No casket is required. The body is placed in the chamber with a simple biodegradable shroud or no covering at all.</p>
          <p class="list-title">Urn Options</p>
          <p>Families receive processed remains and may choose the same urn options as cremation: display urns, biodegradable urns, keepsake urns, or scattering tubes.</p>
          <p class="list-title">Burial Options</p>
          <p>Remains may be buried in a cemetery, placed in a niche, scattered, or kept at home, just like cremated remains.</p>

      <div class="disposition-group">
        <h3 class="disposition-category">Natural Organic Reduction (Human Composting)</h3>
        <article class="option">
          <p>The body is placed in a vessel with organic materials such as wood chips and straw. Over several weeks, natural processes transform the body into nutrient-rich soil.</p>
          <p class="list-title">Container</p>
          <p>No casket or vault is used. A simple biodegradable shroud covers the body. Embalming is not permitted.</p>
          <p class="list-title">Soil Options</p>
          <p>Families typically receive one cubic yard of soil. They may take all of it home, receive a portion, or donate some or all to conservation land or forest restoration projects.</p>
          <p class="list-title">Soil Designation</p>
          <p>Soil can be used in a private garden, placed around a memorial tree, spread on family land, or donated to partner organizations for ecological restoration.</p>

Ask providers about their policies for family involvement.</p>

      <ul class="conflict-list">
